# Investigating sound levels in Dublin city center using Smart Dublin API

This project investigated sound levels in Dublin City at different stages over approximately five years. 

Noise level data was collected from several different individual monitors in Dublin using requests to the SmartDublin API. 

After the different monitor data was merged together various analyses were carried out including an investigation in to the effect of the covid-19 lockdown response, holiday periods and different weather conditions on detectable sound levels in the city. 

Following this it was investigated if a supervised machine learning approach could be used to predict sound levels of an individual monitor. Regression models and a decision tree regressor model were trained using weather features, time of day and traffic volumes and the performance metrics of the models were assessed and compared.
